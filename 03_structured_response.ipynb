    "2. The results of your experiments in `results/part_3/prompting_results.txt` with the format shown above\n",
    "\n",
    "The auto-grader will check:\n",
    "1. That your results file contains the required sections\n",
    "2. That your scoring logic correctly identifies keyword presence\n",
    "3. That you've correctly calculated average scores\n",
    "4. That you've identified the best performing method"
